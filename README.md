# foocafeReliability

Tools and examples for use in the time-to-event analytics sessions at Foocafe in
Malmö.

## General info
Time-to-Event (TtE) Analytics is an especially important concept when performing
survival analysis. This package focuses on worked examples taken from the
book 'Bayesian Reliability' by Hamada et. al.. A variety of examples are used to
demonstrate how various types of reliability models can be implemented in
rstan.

## Technologies
* R - version 3.6.0
* Rstan - version 2.19.2

## Setup
Rstan needs to be installed. Instructions can be found here:
https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started

Other useful information can be found here:

## Status
Project is: _in progress_. A workshop will be held on March 31st 2020 at FooCafe
in Malmö and modifications will be made before that takes place.

## Resources used

Hamada, Michael S., et al. Bayesian reliability. Springer Science & Business Media, 2008.

Another example comes from the article 'Modelling Cesored
Time-to-Event Data Using Pyro, an Open Source Probabilistic Programming
Language'.
